This colab was created based on [python-audio-separator](https://github.com/karaokenerds/python-audio-separator) (a CLI version of UVR5) and [MVSEP-MDX23-Colab_v2](https://github.com/jarredou/MVSEP-MDX23-Colab_v2) repositories. This includes:
* All VR Arch Models
* All MDX-NET Models
* Demucs v4 Models
* MDX23C Models
* BS-Roformer ViperX Models
* VIP Models
* Batch Separation
* Youtube Audio Downloader

## How To Use
1. In your Google Drive account create 2 folders. One for the audios you are going to separate and another where the separated files will be saved.

2. Upload all the audios you want to separate into the folder you created.

3. Run the first cell and give it access permissions to Google Drive.

4. Place the paths to the folders you created in Google Drive then select the model you want to use and its parameters, then run the cell.

5. Now you have the separated audios in the output folder!

**Extra:**
You can download the audio of a YouTube video by entering the link of the video, the path where it will be saved (it is recommended that it be the same where you save the audios that you are going to separate) and the audio format.
